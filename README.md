# InfinityRunner
This is a Infinity Runner game prototype where you collect coin along the gameplay to buy upgrade to help you or you can buy items.

All the ui and 2d sprites are from a free asset in unity store. 

The music sounds is from PlayOnLoop.com and all the SFX are from FreeSound.com.

I made this game to improve my knowledge of unity and c# skills. 

Play the game and enjoy.
